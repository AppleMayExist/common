# common stuff I use
common functions that I use in js, and it would be nice to not write out in every project as if reciting a poem.\
despite the name, it uses es modules instead of common.js.\
all the code is also mainly for [Deno](https://deno.land "Deno | A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript."), though I'm sure it's useful in other environments.\
any code contributions are expected to be under "The Unlicense", otherwise they will be rejected.
